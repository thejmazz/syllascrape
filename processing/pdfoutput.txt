CSC148, Winter 2015
course information sheet
CSC148, "Introduction to Computer Science," introduces you to how our discipline thinks in a systematic
way about computing. Our hope is to provide you the basics for approaching program design principles
such as encapsulation, modularity, and information-hiding, comparing different program implementations
for efficiency, and building powerful data structures. Here's a summary of the administrative details for
Winter 2015. Please visit the course web page http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc148h/winter/ often,
and read email sent to your U of T email for important announcements.
Contact: Each week, other than reading week (February 16th­20th), we'll meet
Lecture 0101: Mondays and Wednesdays, 9­10 a.m., WB116 (Wallberg Building), instructor Diane
Horton
Lecture 0201: Mondays and Wednedays, 10­11 a.m., WB116 (Wallberg Building), instructor Danny
Heap
Lecture 5101: Wednesdays, 6­8 p.m., MS3153 (Medical Science Building), instructor Danny Heap
. . . for discussion and worked examples. If you have questions that aren't answered in class, Danny's
office hours are in BA4270 Mondays and Wednesdays 11:30­1:30. Diane's office hours are Mondays
and Tuesdays, 3­4 p.m. in BA4236.
Textbook and computing: We'll provide slides and links to readings online relevant to our weekly topics. By
virtue of registering in this course, you will have a CDF account, and it is vitally important that you
set it up so that you are able to log in. Your CDF account provides computing resources both remotely
and within the Bahen building, and it allows you to submit course work.
Syllabus: We'll discuss the following topics:
 modularity, encapsulation, information-hiding, object oriented design
 recursive data structures and recursive programming techniques
 traversal and mutation of linked data structures, including trees
 efficiency, profiling
 algorithms, sorting
Marking scheme: The marking scheme is designed to place a low weight (40%) on the final exam, since
we believe this reduces a potential source of stress for students. In order to do this, we have to
introduce frequent-but-smaller sources of stress: ten (nearly-weekly) labs, a courSe bLOG (SLOG),
three assignments, and two term tests. These are timed, and weighted, as follows:
1
Work Due Weight
10 labs every week except week 1 and week 12 10%
SLOG and three assignments
SLOG, week 3 ­ end of course
32%
A1, January 29th, 10 p.m.
A2, March 5th, 10 p.m.
A3, April 2nd, 10 p.m.
two term tests
T1, February 4th, during lecture time
18%
T2, March 11th, during lecture time
Final exam some time in April 40%
Nuances: Everybody has better and worse days. We aim to give higher weight to your better work.
For example, the weights of the assignments and SLOG sum to 32%, so we will give your best work
on these three a weight of 10%, and your worst work a weight of 6%, with your middling work getting
weights of 9% and 7%, respectively. Similarly, the term tests sum to 18%, so your best effort will
have weight 10% and your lesser effort will have weight 6%, and there is 1% per test for completing a
test-review exercise. The 40% weight of the final is, however, not changeable.
In addition to the other requirements, must you achieve 40% of the marks on the final exam in order
to pass this course.
Re-marks: It is very important to us that your work is evaluated correctly, and that occasionally includes
re-marking work to see whether we agree with the original grading. On the other hand, there are often
urgent tasks during the semester that require our attention ahead of re-marks, for example preparing
the next lecture, assignment, test...
Here is how we propose to balance importance and urgency. All re-mark requests must be submitted
on MarkUs within 7 days of when the relevant work is handed back. We promise to consider the
request before we submit grades at the end of the course.
Lateness, sickness, natural disasters: We discourage late work, since we have to arrange in advance for grading
it, and because we want to be able to discuss solutions soon after the assignment is due, while it is still
fresh in everyone's minds. Late assignments will be penalized at the rate of 5% per hour. If you have
special circumstances that force you to miss a deadline, please contact us immediately (usually before
the work is due) and fill out either the "Request for special consideration," or the standard medical
excuse form (link on course web page) and provide all supporting documentation. We will do our best
to ensure that your evaluation is not harmed by events that are not your fault.
Independent work: It is a serious academic offense to pass off somebody else's work as your own for credit.
Be sure to give full and generous credit to any person or book (except course instructors and teaching
assistants) you consult in solving assignments. If you take notes when you consult a source, quote that
source in full.
If you intend to present work as your own, for credit, then you should not look at similar work by
other students, in written or electronic form, since looking can easily turn into plagiarism. Don't show
your own assignments to other students. Take a couple of hours' break after even verbal discussions
of the assignment before writing it up.
Email, piazza: Course instructors receive thousands of emails per month, which makes it hard to ensure that
each piece is followed up on promptly. You should use email to instructors sparingly.
Use piazza (see course web page) for questions and answers that don't reveal the details of assign-
ments. Use MarkUs to request (non-test) re-marks and special consideration. Test re-marks need to
be presented on paper (form on course web site), stapled to the test, to your instructor.
If you have a question that can't be raised on piazza and is suitable for email, be sure to include
"CSC148," and something about your question, in the Subject: line.
