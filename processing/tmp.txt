Pre-Requisites, and Ramp-Up Session(s)
The pre-requisites for the course are CSC148 and CSC165.
The main material from CSC148 that we rely on is a solid understanding of recursion and recursive data-structures
      (such as trees).
     The material from CSC165 that we rely on is all of it!
     If you understood that material well, you are well-prepared for this course.
On the other hand, if you achieved less than a C in CSC165, you will
       likely find the material we present in CSC236 unreasonably challenging,
       requiring more remedial work than you can combine with other responsibilities this semester.
      Some of you have a CSC165 transfer credit, or a waiver based on other "similar" courses,
       or you might not have taken CSC165 recently and have forgotten some of it.
      Take a look at the CSC165 Practice Questions,
       especially the sections on "Sequences" and "General Proofs": can you easily develop the structure of a proof based
       on the structure of the statement being proved (and vice-versa).
      Also, take a look at last term's CSC236 Assignment 0 that was on some of the CSC165 material.
If you are concerned about whether you are ready for this course, there is a "ramp up"
       session being introduced (similar in spirit to the CSC148 "ramp up") on the CSC165 material:
       e-mail us at csc236-rampup@cs.toronto.edu with your CDF ID and whether you can attend
       if we were to schedule a session this Saturday January 10th from 10AM–4PM,
       and/or next Saturday January 17th from 10AM–4PM.
