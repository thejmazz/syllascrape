CSC148, Winter 2014
course information sheet
CSC148, ‚ÄúIntroduction to Computer Science,‚Äù introduces you to how our discipline thinks in a systematic
way about computing. Our hope is to provide you the basics for approaching program design principles
such as encapsulation, modularity, and information-hiding, comparing diÔ¨Äerent program implementations
for eÔ¨Éciency, and building powerful data structures. Here‚Äôs a summary of the administrative details for
Winter 2014. Please visit the course web page http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~heap/148/W14/ often, and
read email sent to your U of T email for important announcements.
Contact: Each week, other than reading week (February 17th‚Äì21st), we‚Äôll meet
Lecture 0101: Mondays and Wednesdays, 9‚Äì10 a.m., WB116 (Wallberg Building), instructor Danny
Heap
Lecture 0201: Mondays and Wednedays, 10‚Äì11 a.m., WB116 (Wallberg Building), instructor Danny
Heap
Lecture 5101: Wednesdays, 6‚Äì8 p.m., MS3153 (Medical Science Building), instructor Dustin Wehr
. . . for discussion and worked examples. If you have questions that aren‚Äôt answered in class, Danny‚Äôs
oÔ¨Éce hours are in BA4270 Mondays and Wednesdays 11‚Äìnoon, and Thursdays 2‚Äì4 p.m. Dustin‚Äôs oÔ¨Éce
hours are in SF 4306 D on Tuesdays 5‚Äì6 p.m. and Wednesdays 2‚Äì3 p.m.
Textbook and computing: We‚Äôll provide slides and links to readings online relevant to our weekly topics. By
virtue of registering in this course, you will have a CDF account, and it is vitally important that you
set it up so that you are able to log in. Your CDF account provides computing resources both remotely
and within the Bahen building, and it allows you to submit course work.
Syllabus: We‚Äôll discuss the following topics:
 modularity, encapsulation, information-hiding, object oriented design
 recursive data structures and recursive programming techniques
 traversal and mutation of linked data structures, including trees
 eÔ¨Éciency, proÔ¨Åling
 algorithms, sorting
Marking scheme: The marking scheme is designed to place a low weight (40%) on the Ô¨Ånal exam, since we
believe this reduces a potential source of stress for students. In order to do this, we have to introduce
frequent-but-smaller sources of stress: ten (nearly-weekly) labs, four exercises, a courSe bLOG (SLOG),
two assignments, two term tests. These are timed, and weighted, as follows:
1
Work Due Weight
10 labs every week except week 1 and week 12 10%
SLOG and two assignments
SLOG, week 3 ‚Äì end of course
24%
A1, February 13th, 9:59 p.m.
A2 part I, March 6th, 9:59 p.m.
A2 part II, March 20th, 9:59 p.m.
four exercises
January 16th, 30th, 9:59 p.m.
8%
March 13th, 9:59 p.m.
April 3rd, 9:59 p.m.
two term tests
T1, February 26th, during lecture time
18%
T2, March 26th, during lecture time
Final exam some time during exam period 40%
Nuances: Everybody has better and worse days. We aim to give higher weight to your better work.
For example, the weights of the assignments and SLOG sum to 24%, so we will give your best work on
these three a weight of 10%, and your worst work a weight of 6%, with the remaining piece getting 8%.
Similarly, the term tests sum to 18%, so your best eÔ¨Äort will have weight 11% and your lesser eÔ¨Äort
will have weight 7%. After you have completed the 5th lab, you may choose to replace the remaining 5
labs shifting those marks to your term tests (which become worth 23% in that case). The 40% weight
of the Ô¨Ånal is, however, not changeable.
In addition to the other requirements, must you achieve 40% of the marks on the Ô¨Ånal exam in order
to pass this course.
Re-marks: It is very important to us that your work is evaluated correctly, and that occasionally includes
re-marking work to see whether we agree with the original grading. On the other hand, there are often
urgent tasks during the semester that require our attention ahead of re-marks, for example preparing
the next lecture, assignment, test...
Here is how we propose to balance importance and urgency. All re-mark requests must be submitted
on MarkUs within 7 days of when the relevant work is handed back. We promise to consider the
request before we submit grades at the end of the course.
Lateness, sickness, natural disasters: We don‚Äôt accept late work, since we have to arrange in advance for grading
it, and because we want to be able to discuss solutions soon after the assignment is due, while it is
still fresh in everyone‚Äôs minds. However, if you have special circumstances that force you to miss a
deadline, please contact us immediately (usually before the work is due) and Ô¨Åll out either the ‚ÄúRequest
for special consideration,‚Äù or the standard medical excuse form (link on this web page) and provide all
supporting documentation. We will do our best to ensure there is no penalty for a deadline missed for
a valid reason.
Independent work: It is a serious academic oÔ¨Äense to pass oÔ¨Ä somebody else‚Äôs work as your own for credit.
Be sure to give full and generous credit to any person or book (except course instructors and teaching
assistants) you consult in solving assignments. If you take notes when you consult a source, quote that
source in full.
If you intend to present work as your own, for credit, then you should not look at similar work by
other students, in written or electronic form, since looking can easily turn into plagiarism. Don‚Äôt show
your own assignments to other students. Take a couple of hours‚Äô break after even verbal discussions
of the assignment before writing it up.
